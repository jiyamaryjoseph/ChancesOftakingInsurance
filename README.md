# Gradient-Descend in Linear Regression/Logistic Regression( by using numpy / Tensorflow) 



## DL- Gradient Descend for Neural network (logistic regression).ipnb : Gradient Descent in Neural Network.(Deeplearning-(Insurance-Data))
 Gradient Descent is a term that you will often hear in Neural Network. Indeed, the optimization/learning phase of Neural Network (backpropagation) use gradient descent as a method to update the various weight.
   The insurance_data.csv is attached here.By using this data here I am predicting the chance of taking insurance by age and affordability..In this data age and afffordability are the features.Scaling is also using on age for improving accuracy. 
    For reducing loss here i am using log loss function and To get range (0,1) by sigmoid function..
###### Comparing numpy method and tensorflow.keras 
  
  In the end we are able to come up with same value of w1,w2 and bias using plain python implimentation of gradient descent function.
